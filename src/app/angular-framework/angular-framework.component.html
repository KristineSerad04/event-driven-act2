       <h2>About Me</h2>

       <p>As a person, I am very passionate. My passion is towards making my creativity take over my body and contribute to the beauties of the world. Through my monumental effort and responsibility, I strive to make a miniscule change in this world. I want to share love and compassion towards every being and strive to understand the perspective of each as inseparable parts of God, just like me, you, and anybody else. I believe that every being deserves respect as all are holy and magnificent creations of God. If I perceive it as bad or wrong, then God just wants me to learn a deep lesson, and that those experiences only serve to make me grow and learn. The institutions that govern our society are tools for growth for each and every person, and so, I also act as a responsible citizen by doing my best in my academic life in school and abide to the law that contributes to the order and peace in society.</p>
